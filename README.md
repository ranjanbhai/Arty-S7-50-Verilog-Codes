# Arty-S7-50-Verilog-Codes
Tested working codes for Digilent Arty S7-50 Xilinx Spartan 7 based FPGA board written in Verilog. XDC files are also included.

* Full Adder (*full_adder*) - works using the switches and LEDs. The switches serve as inputs (A, B, and Carry_in) and the LEDs serve as outputs (Sum and Carry_out)
  * Mapping:
    - SW[0] = A
    - SW[1] = B
    - SW[2] = Carry_in
    - LED[0] = Sum
    - LED[1] = Carry_out
